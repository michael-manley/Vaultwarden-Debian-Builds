  Major changes and New Features
  
  * WebSocket notifications now work via the default HTTP port. No need for WEBSOCKET_ENABLED and a separate port anymore.
  * The proxy examples still need to be updated for this. Support for the old websockets port 3012 will remain for the time being.
  * Mobile Client push notification support, see #3304 thanks @GeekCornerGH!
  * Web-Vault updated to v2023.5.0 (v2023.5.1 does not add any improvements for us)
  * The latest Bitwarden Directory Connector can be used now (v2022.11.0)
  * Storing passkeys is supported, though the clients are not yet released. So, it might be we need to make some changes once they are released.
  * See: #3593, thanks @GeekCornerGH!
